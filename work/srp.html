            <p>In 2019, Jet Airways ceased operations. JetPrivilege had become an independent entity some time earlier, but the flight redemption process was still linked to Jet Airways.<br><br>To continue providing value to customers, the team developed a model for customers to earn / redeem miles on any airline. This consisted of two fare types - ‘Standard Award’ and ‘Select Award’. Standard Award tickets were fixed price for a given segment with limited availability. Select fare tickets were more expensive, but had more ticket availability.<br><br>When JetPrivilege was rebranded, ‘Select Award’ was renamed to ‘Flexi Award’.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3><br>
            <p>Jet Airways had a published redemption table and customers were comparing our fares against it. Members were used to the Jet fare structure for redemption with fares linked to cabin class. Consequently, there was some confusion about the difference between the  two fares since they were no longer linked to cabin class. Additionally, the second fare was now named 'Flexi', falsely indicating that there was flexibility associated with tickets purchased at this fare.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How I Contributed</h3><br>
            <p>I initiated a discussion and proposed that we do away with visual indications of the fare types. Members would still have tickets available to them in both fare types, but they wouldn’t be looking for additional value in a more expensive fare.<br><br>This was met with some hesitation. The stakeholders wanted to reinforce to loyal members that we were still selling tickets at the Standard Award fare. I suggested that we do this in a different manner and proposed a few alternatives.</p>

            <h3>Challenges, Lessons, and the Way Forward</h3><br>
            <p>The stakeholders still believed that the existing approach had value. Lacking the resources to conduct research, I was unable to make a strong case in support of removing the fares types entirely. However, customer service reports provided evidence of the need for better communication. We had recieved a fair number of calls asking for clarification on the fares, and some irate calls from customers who wanted to reschedule tickets of the 'Flexi Award' type.<br><br>I proposed that we do away with the term 'Flexi', and that the focus be shifted from the name to the fare amount. I also revised the mobile designs to allow both fares to be viewed upfront - this would provide more clarity in cases where Standard Award tickets were unavailable. These were agreed upon and implemented.</p>
