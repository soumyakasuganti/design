            <h3>Context</h3><br>
            <p>In 2019, Jet Airways ceased operations. To continue providing value to customers, the team developed a model for customers to redeem miles on any airline.</p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3><br>
            <p>Jet Airways had a published fare structure for redemption and customers were comparing our fares against it. This led to some confusion. Additionally, the second fare was now named 'Flexi', falsely indicating that there was flexibility associated with tickets purchased at this fare.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How I Contributed</h3><br>
            <p>I initiated a discussion and proposed that we do away with visual indications of the fare types. Members would still have tickets available to them in both fare types, but they wouldn’t be looking for additional value in a more expensive fare.<br><br>This was met with some hesitation. The stakeholders wanted to reinforce to loyal members that we were still providing the same value as before.</p>

            <h3>Challenges, Lessons, and the Way Forward</h3><br>
            <p>Lacking the resources to conduct additional research, I was unable to make a strong case in support of removing the fares types entirely. However, customer service reports provided evidence of the need for better communication.<br><br>I made revisions, shifting the focus from the name to the fare amount. I also revised the mobile designs to allow both fares to be viewed upfront.</p>
