            <p>JetPrivilege started out as Jet Airways’ well-loved frequent flyer program, and about five years ago, became an independent entity. Since then, Jet Airways shut down operations. This brought some changes to the way customers interacted with the brand. Members would now be able to earn and redeem miles on any airline and thus a flight booking platform was built.<br><br>The first order of business was to get a working platform live. This was achieved. Next, the focus was on improving the booking experience.</p><br>
            <h3>The Plan</h3><br>
            <p>The product development team conducted a workshop to identify features that the team wanted to have included. The design team was to perform an evaluation of the existing platform and of a selected list of other platforms.<br>This is when I joined the team.</p><br>
            <h3>How I Contributed</h3><br>
            <p>I started the project with one other designer, working with her to evaluate the platforms identified. We shared our findings with the stakeholders, highlighting what we thought worked well, and also addressing the list of features that came out of the product workshop. We came away from the discussion with a list of ideas to be explored further.</p>

            <h3>Exploration</h3><br>
            <p>From this point on, I was the sole designer on the project. I mapped the user flow, outlining alternatives, which I then fleshed out as wireframes. I led a discussion with the stakeholders, suggesting further simplification of the flow. A feasibility check was also done at this point leading to the elimination of a couple of features.</p>

            <p>During the visual design phase, the company rebranded. We were now InterMiles.<br><br>I iterated, factoring in the design changes that arose from the rebranding process, and sought additional feedback from the design team to ensure that I hadn’t missed anything in the bustle.</p>

            <h3>Flight Details - Improving Readability</h3><br>
              <p>The old version didn't indicate where the user was in the booking process. I added a step indicator, providing a point of reference.</p><br>
              <p>I updated the header, using it to reiterate the origin, destination, and trip type (one way / round trip). I also redesigned the flight information for improved readability, with labels to quickly identify the onward and return flights.</p><br>
              <p>Based on insights from the product workshop, with inputs from the business team, I added an offers section. I added the fare to the fixed footer to make any discounts or additional charges immediately evident.</p>

            <h3>Traveller Details - Reducing Complexity</h3><br>
            <p>I revised the input interaction for the title field from a dropdown to a chip selection.</p><br><p>I collapsed the frequent flier and GST sections, which were filled out infrequently, making the page length more manageable.</p><br>
            <h3>Ancillaries - Providing Control</h3><br>
            <p>I added tabs for navigation between ancillaries, showing all of them on a single screen.</p>
            <br><p>I brought the seat legend into the body of the page, condensing the footer. I removed the flight outline, allowing for dynamic seat map rendering, and increasing the size of the touch target for seat selection.</p>
            <br><p>I also designed the newly added lounge section.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3><br>
            <p>Learning from previous projects, I scheduled walkthroughs directly with the tech team, trying to catch any gaps or feasibility issues before development began. I stayed in constant contact with the development team, testing early demos for functional issues. I subsequently tested for visual design issues, working with the front end team to resolve discrepancies.</p><br>
            <h3>Challenges and Growth</h3><br>
            <p>Given the changes to the team and the business during the course of the project, I had to handle a certain level of ambiguity, deal with changes to the scope of work, and manage my time with greater skill. The number of stakeholders involved in this project made decision making somewhat challenging at times. I used the experience to modify my process in subsequent projects, with some success.</p>
