            <h3>Context</h3><br>
            <p>JetPrivilege, previously Jet Airways' loyalty program, became an independent entity. Members would now be able to earn and redeem miles on any airline and thus a flight booking platform was built. Once it was live, we focused on improving the booking experience.</p><br>
            <h3>Discovery</h3><br>
            <p>I performed a comparative assessment, evaluating our existing platform against a selected list of platforms. Following this I led a strategy workshop, highlighting the need to simplify user interactions and to provide better visibility and freedom to the user during the booking process.</p>

            <h3>Exploration</h3><br>
            <p>With the strategy in place I mapped the user flow, outlining alternatives, which I then fleshed out as wireframes. I led a discussion with the stakeholders, sharing recommendations for further simplification. A feasibility check was also conducted at this point.</p><br>
            <p>During the visual design phase, the company rebranded. I iterated, factoring in the design changes that arose from the rebranding process, and sought additional feedback from the team.</p>

            <h3>Flight Details - Improving Readability</h3><br>
              <p>The old version didn't indicate where the user was in the booking process. I added a step indicator, providing a point of reference.</p><br>
              <p>I updated the header, using it to reiterate the origin, destination, and trip type (one way / round trip). I also redesigned the flight information for improved readability, with labels to quickly identify the onward and return flights.</p><br>
              <p>Based on insights from the product workshop, with inputs from the business team, I added an offers section. I added the fare to the fixed footer to make any discounts or additional charges immediately evident.</p>

            <h3>Traveller Details - Reducing Complexity</h3><br>
            <p>I revised the input interaction for the title field from a dropdown to a chip selection.</p><br><p>I collapsed the frequent flier and GST sections, which were filled out infrequently, making the page length more manageable.</p><br>
            <h3>Ancillaries - Providing Control</h3><br>
            <p>I added tabs for navigation between ancillaries, showing all of them on a single screen.</p>
            <br><p>I brought the seat legend into the body of the page, condensing the footer. I removed the flight outline, allowing for dynamic seat map rendering, and increasing the size of the touch target for seat selection.</p>
            <br><p>I also designed the newly added lounge section.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3><br>
            <p>Learning from previous projects, I scheduled walkthroughs directly with the tech team, trying to catch any gaps or feasibility issues before development began. I stayed in constant contact with the development team, testing early demos for functional issues. I subsequently tested for visual design issues, working with the front end team to resolve discrepancies.</p><br>
            <h3>Challenges and Growth</h3><br>
            <p>Given the changes to the team and the business during the course of the project, I had to handle a certain level of ambiguity, deal with changes to the scope of work, and manage my time with greater skill. The number of stakeholders involved in this project made decision making somewhat challenging at times. Usability testing earlier in the process would have helped significantly as well. I used the experience to modify my process in subsequent projects. </p><br>
