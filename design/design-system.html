            <h3>Context</h3><br>
            <p>The design team at InterMiles grew from a single designer to a team of six. As new products were designed, we started to see inconsistencies in the visual language.</p><br>
            <h3>Task</h3><br>
            <p>In an effort to streamline design and development efforts, and provide a cohesive user experience, the design team created and maintained a set of guidelines and a library of components.</p><br>

            <h3>The Process</h3><br>
            <p>To begin, a core team of three designers dedicated a week to establishing basic guidelines and a foundation of components for reuse. We inventoried elements and patterns, identified variations, and standardized them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With the foundation in place, we set up and maintained a weekly cadence, identifying additional components and resolving any issues that arose when components were put into use. For communication and reference, we used a combination of InVision's Design System Manager and Zeplin's Styleguides.</p><br>

            <h3>Implementation</h3><br>
            <p>We walked the development team through the styleguide and component library, ensuring that use cases and component behaviours were understood. The dev team demoed components as they were built - any discrepancies were discussed and addressed.</p><br>

            <h3>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h3><br>
            <p>With the new design system in place, a large number of screens needed to be updated, leading to some additional effort.<br><br>Even with a common point of reference, communicating updates and maintaining consistency was a challenge. We established a practice of regular and open communication (MS Teams), raising and fixing issues as and when they were identified.<br><br>We are already starting to see the benefits from setting up the design system. With the visual language defined, we are spending more time on the user experience, and are able to prototype faster.</p>
