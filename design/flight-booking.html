            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>JetPrivilege, previously Jet Airways' loyalty program, became an independent entity. Members could now earn and redeem miles on any airline.</p><br>
            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>Redesigning the booking experience to reflect the new value proposition and brand identity, benchmarking against common OTA and airline user experiences.</p><br>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>Designer (pair design), design lead.</p><br>

            <h3>Strategy</h3><br>
            <p>The business was undergoing a major shift, and the product needed to go to market fast. The decision was made to release an MVP and subsequently carry out research and testing. There was still a need to meet customer expectations, so we analyzed a selected list of booking platforms, noting common practices and possible areas of improvement.</p><br>
            <h3>Discovery and Ideation</h3><br>
            <p>Equipped with insights from the analysis, we mapped the user flow, outlined alternatives, and fleshed them out as wireframes. We then conducted a workshop, soliciting feedback from the product and leadership teams. The feasibility of the proposed solution(s) was also checked at this point.</p>

            <h3>Phase 2 — Search Results</h3><br>
            <p>The search results proved to be challenging to do well within the 3 week time frame. We decided to focus on </p><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Highlighting the miles earning for each flight</li>
              <li>Enabling selection of onward and return flights simultaneously</li>
              <li>Displaying filters prominently</li>

            <h3>Phase 3 — Booking Review</h3><br>
            <p>During this phase I took over as design lead and worked on the project independently. I focused on simplifying the journey as much as possible</p><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Making flight information easy to scan</li>
              <li>Highlighting halt / layover information</li>
              <li>Minimizing the traveller information collected</li>
              <li>Collapsing infrequently used sections, such as frequent flier and GST</li>
              <li>Simplifying title input on mobile using chips</li>
              <li>Providing greater control in the add-ons sections using tabs</li>
              <li>Enabling the skip option for add-ons</li>
            </ul><br>
            <p>The company rebranded at this time, leading to added complexity during prototyping. I sought additional feedback from the design team to ensure consistency was maintained.</p>

            <h3>Phase 4 — Confirmation</h3><br>
            <p>This phase was combined with the manage booking flow and is covered in the <a href="bcp-mmb.html" target="">post booking experience</a> case study.</p><br>
            <h3>Learnings</h3><br>
            <p>Usability testing earlier in the process would have helped significantly. Though we did some testing internally, guerilla research methods might have helped achieve a better outcome at the MVP stage. <br><br>The number of stakeholders involved in this project made decision making somewhat challenging at times. I used the experience to modify my process in subsequent projects, making sure that user experience decisions and feasibility checks were handled and documented early on in the process.<br><br>Given the changes to the team and the business during the course of the project, I had to handle a certain level of ambiguity, deal with changes to the scope of work, and manage my time with greater skill.</p><br>
