            <h3>Context</h3><br>
            <p>Augl is a platform for small businesses and service providers, helping them design, deploy and manage custom apps using google forms, so they can support their clients in turn.</p><br>
            <h3>My Role</h3><br>
            <p>I redesigned the brand identity, designed the website architecture, and mapped the user journey for the product.</p>

            <h3>The Brand Identity</h3><br>
            <p>The existing Augl logo had some negative connotations, and the team wanted it revised quickly. I sketched concepts and presented them. The one that resonated most strongly was versatile and was based on the process of setting up an Augl app.</p>
            <br><h3>The Website and Platform</h3><br>
            <p>I conducted a workshop with the Augl team to understand their goals for the website. At the end of the workshop we arrived at a simple architecture that could be scaled as the company grew. I fleshed out the discussed architecture in the form of wireframes.</p>

            <br><h3>User Journey</h3><br>
            <p>The Augl team provided me with case studies of past and current clients. I used these to get a sense of who the users were. We also interacted with a small set of clients to observe the app in use and get feedback. I mapped the user journey for the platform based on the insights obtained, highlighting pain points and opportunities.</p>

            <h3>Learnings and Conclusion</h3><br>
            <p>As a consultant, I had the opportunity to design the process in addition to the work itself. Setting expectations upfront and being transparent in all my decisions helped keep us aligned throughout the project. Unfortunately, Augl didn't raise the funds they had hoped to, and the project wasn't extended.</p>
