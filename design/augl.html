            <h3>Context</h3><br>
            <p>Augl is a platform for small businesses and service providers, helping them design, deploy and manage custom apps to support their clients in turn.<br><br>The team started out making white label apps for a small set of users, and was looking to create a web platform to enable customers to create their own apps with Google Forms. They hired me to redesign the brand identity, map the user journey, and design and build their website.</p>

            <h3>The Brand Identity</h3><br>
            <p>The existing Augl logo had some negative connotations, and the team wanted it revised quickly. I sketched concepts and presented them. The one that resonated most strongly was versatile and was based on the process of setting up an Augl app.</p>
            <br><h3>The Website and Platform</h3><br>
            <p>I conducted a workshop with the Augl team to understand their goals for the website. At the end of the workshop we arrived at a simple architecture that could be scaled as the company grew. I fleshed out the discussed architecture in the form of wireframes.</p>

            <p>I parallely started working on the user journey for the platform. The team provided me with case studies of past and current clients. I used these to get a sense of who the users were. We also interacted with a small set of clients to see the app in use and get some feedback.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3><br>
            <p>Though the team initiated the project, and participated throughout, they were reluctant to go ahead with changes until they received further funding. They didn’t end up raising the funds they had hoped to, and the project ended mid-way. </p>
