            <h3>Context</h3><br>
            <p>Bookings in the existing system were hard to access. Furthermore, the system provided limited visibility of status and little or no freedom to manage bookings. Consequently, most requests / issues were handled by the customer service team, causing heavy loads and long wait times.</p><br>
            <h3>The Planned Outcome</h3><br>
            <p>A comprehensive booking management system, planned in phases, giving the user complete visibility and control over their bookings and refunds.</p><br>
            <h3>How I Contributed</h3><br>
            <p>I designed the post booking experience for the flights product, starting with a flowchart to identify task flows and back end processes. I juxtaposed these with low fidelity wireframes to facilitate a strategy workshop. The outcome was a shared vision for the project, a roadmap, and an understanding of potential issues. With the roadmap in place, I designed and tested prototypes for the first two phases. These became a part of the design system and have subsequently been used across multiple products.</p>

            <h3>Design Decisions</h3><br>
            <p>I proposed that we have separate booking confirmation and manage booking experiences based on user goals at these stages. The confirmation page would provide a brief summary of the booking, and focus on cross-selling our other offerings. The manage booking page on the other hand would focus on booking details and the options available to the user.<br><br>I provided visibility for failed bookings, and added a tracker allowing users to stay updated on their requests and refunds.<br><br>I also proposed that we display the major modification options earlier in the user flow, allowing users to differentiate between a partial and complete cancellation, a refund for a cancelled flight, etc.</p>

            <p>COVID 19 has had a significant impact on the travel industry, leading to some modifications to the roadmap. This has allowed additional time for heuristic evaluation and usability testing.</p>
