            <h3>Context</h3><br>
            <p>Circle the City is a non-profit organization that provides holistic healthcare to individuals experiencing homelessness. I volunteered to help them with the design of their website.</p><br>
            <h3>How I Contributed</h3><br>
            <p>I visited the Circle the City facility and met the core team to get a better understanding of their goals. The website needed to do a better job of communicating their story and getting people involved as volunteers or donors. I redesigned the architecture with this in mind. I also designed responsive prototypes for the website.</p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3><br>
            <p>The solution was received well. The redesign of the site was taken up by another team of volunteers, incorporating some of the ideas I proposed.</p>
